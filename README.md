 
# Django Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Django Backend & API Mastery Roadmap**!  
This repository documents my full learning path from **beginner to advanced Django developer**.  
It includes code projects, notes, and diagrams.

## 🎯 Goals
- Master Django fundamentals (projects, apps, models, views).
- Build REST APIs with Django REST Framework.
- Learn authentication, permissions, caching, signals.
- Deploy Django in production with Docker, Gunicorn, and Nginx.
- Explore advanced APIs (GraphQL, WebSockets).
- Gain skills to build professional backends and SaaS apps.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder represents a **learning module** with projects and notes:
- `01-django-basics` → First project, URLs, views, templates.

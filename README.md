 
# Django Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Django Backend & API Mastery Roadmap**!  
This repository documents my full learning path from **beginner to advanced Django developer**.  
It includes code projects, notes, and diagrams.

## 🎯 Goals
- Master Django fundamentals (projects, apps, models, views).
- Build REST APIs with Django REST Framework.
- Learn authentication, permissions, caching, signals.
- Deploy Django in production with Docker, Gunicorn, and Nginx.
- Explore advanced APIs (GraphQL, WebSockets).
- Gain skills to build professional backends and SaaS apps.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder represents a **learning module** with projects and notes:
- `01-django-basics` → First project, URLs, views, templates.
- `02-models-orm` → Django ORM, models, relationships.
- `03-auth-forms` → Authentication & user management.
- `04-rest-apis` → Building APIs with Django REST Framework.
- `05-advanced-django` → Middleware, signals, caching.
- `06-production-deployment` → Docker, Gunicorn, Nginx.
- `07-advanced-apis` → GraphQL, Channels (WebSockets).

## 🗺 Roadmap
Check the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for step-by-step learning instructions.

## 🖼 Diagrams
See `/diagrams` for visual explanations (Request cycle, ORM, MVC).

## ⚡ Timeline
Designed to be completed in **8 weeks** with focused daily practice.
